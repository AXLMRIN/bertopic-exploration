"Abstract Large language models (LLMs) are capable of successfully performing many language processing tasks zero-shot (without training data). If zero-shot LLMs can also reliably classify and explain social phenomena like persuasiveness and political ideology, then LLMs could augment the computational social science (CSS) pipeline in important ways. This work provides a road map for using LLMs as CSS tools. Towards this end, we contribute a set of prompting best practices and an extensive evaluation pipeline to measure the zero-shot performance of 13 language models on 25 representative English CSS benchmarks. On taxonomic labeling tasks (classification), LLMs fail to outperform the best fine-tuned models but still achieve fair levels of agreement with humans. On free-form coding tasks (generation), LLMs produce explanations that often exceed the quality of crowdworkers’ gold references. We conclude that the performance of today’s LLMs can augment the CSS research pipeline in two ways: (1) serving as zero-shot data annotators on human annotation teams, and (2) bootstrapping challenging creative generation tasks (e.g., explaining the underlying attributes of a text). In summary, LLMs are posed to meaningfully participate in social science analysis in partnership with humans."
"Abstract Social determinants of health (SDoH) play a critical role in patient outcomes, yet their documentation is often missing or incomplete in the structured data of electronic health records (EHRs). Large language models (LLMs) could enable high-throughput extraction of SDoH from the EHR to support research and clinical care. However, class imbalance and data limitations present challenges for this sparsely documented yet critical information. Here, we investigated the optimal methods for using LLMs to extract six SDoH categories from narrative text in the EHR: employment, housing, transportation, parental status, relationship, and social support. The best-performing models were fine-tuned Flan-T5 XL for any SDoH mentions (macro-F1 0.71), and Flan-T5 XXL for adverse SDoH mentions (macro-F1 0.70). Adding LLM-generated synthetic data to training varied across models and architecture, but improved the performance of smaller Flan-T5 models (delta F1 + 0.12 to +0.23). Our best-fine-tuned models outperformed zero- and few-shot performance of ChatGPT-family models in the zero- and few-shot setting, except GPT4 with 10-shot prompting for adverse SDoH. Fine-tuned models were less likely than ChatGPT to change their prediction when race/ethnicity and gender descriptors were added to the text, suggesting less algorithmic bias ( p &lt; 0.05). Our models identified 93.8% of patients with adverse SDoH, while ICD-10 codes captured 2.0%. These results demonstrate the potential of LLMs in improving real-world evidence on SDoH and assisting in identifying patients who could benefit from resource support."
"Simulation plays a crucial role in addressing various challenges within social science. It offers extensive applications such as state prediction, phenomena explanation, and policy-making support, among others. In this work, we harness the human-like capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in sensing, reasoning, and behaving, and utilize these qualities to construct the S3 system (short for Social network Simulation System). Adhering to the widely employed agent-based simulation paradigm, we employ fine-tuning and prompt engineering techniques to ensure that the agent's behavior closely emulates that of a genuine human within the social network. Specifically, we simulate three pivotal aspects: emotion, attitude, and interaction behaviors. By endowing the agent in the system with the ability to perceive the informational environment and emulate human actions, we observe the emergence of population-level phenomena, including the propagation of information, attitudes, and emotions. We conduct an evaluation encompassing two levels of simulation, employing real-world social network data. Encouragingly, the results demonstrate promising accuracy. This work represents an initial step in the realm of social network simulation empowered by LLM-based agents. We anticipate that our endeavors will serve as a source of inspiration for the development of simulation systems within, but not limited to, social science."

"This perspective highlights the importance of addressing social determinants of health (SDOH) in patient health outcomes and health inequity, a global problem exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. We provide a broad discussion on current developments in digital health and artificial intelligence (AI), including large language models (LLMs), as transformative tools in addressing SDOH factors, offering new capabilities for disease surveillance and patient care. Simultaneously, we bring attention to challenges, such as data standardization, infrastructure limitations, digital literacy, and algorithmic bias, that could hinder equitable access to AI benefits. For LLMs, we highlight potential unique challenges and risks including environmental impact, unfair labor practices, inadvertent disinformation or ""hallucinations,"" proliferation of bias, and infringement of copyrights. We propose the need for a multitiered approach to digital inclusion as an SDOH and the development of ethical and responsible AI practice frameworks globally and provide suggestions on bridging the gap from development to implementation of equitable AI technologies."
"As an integral part of people's daily lives, social media is becoming a rich source for automatic mental health analysis.As traditional discriminative methods bear poor generalization ability and low interpretability, the recent large language models (LLMs) have been explored for interpretable mental health analysis on social media, which aims to provide detailed explanations along with predictions in zero-shot or few-shot settings.The results show that LLMs still achieve unsatisfactory classification performance in a zero-shot/few-shot manner, which further significantly affects the quality of the generated explanations.Domain-specific finetuning is an effective solution, but faces two critical challenges: 1) lack of high-quality training data.2) no open-source foundation LLMs.To alleviate these problems, we formally model interpretable mental health analysis as a text generation task, and build the first multi-task and multi-source interpretable mental health instruction (IMHI) dataset with 105K data samples to support LLM instruction tuning and evaluation.The raw social media data are collected from 10 existing sources covering 8 mental health analysis tasks.We prompt ChatGPT with expert-designed few-shot prompts to obtain explanations.To ensure the reliability of the explanations, we perform strict automatic and human evaluations on the correctness, consistency, and quality of generated data.Based on the IMHI dataset and LLaMA2 foundation models, we train MentaLLaMA, the first open-source instruction-following LLM series for interpretable mental health analysis on social media.We evaluate Men-taLLaMA and other advanced methods on the IMHI benchmark, the first holistic evaluation benchmark for interpretable mental health analysis.The results show that MentaLLaMA approaches state-of-the-art discriminative methods in correctness and generates human-level explanations.MentaLLaMA models also show strong generalizability to unseen tasks.The project is available at https://github.com/SteveKGYang/MentaLLaMA."
"The maturity level of language models is now at a stage in which many companies rely on them to solve various tasks. However, while research has shown how biased and harmful these models are, systematic ways of integrating social bias tests into development pipelines are still lacking. This short paper suggests how to use these verification techniques in development pipelines. We take inspiration from software testing and suggest addressing social bias evaluation as software testing. We hope to open a discussion on the best methodologies to handle social bias testing in language models."
"Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate increasingly human-like abilities across a wide variety of tasks. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs like ChatGPT can accurately infer the psychological dispositions of social media users and whether their ability to do so varies across socio-demographic groups. Specifically, we test whether GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can derive the Big Five personality traits from users' Facebook status updates in a zero-shot learning scenario. Our results show an average correlation of"
"Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to perform well at a variety of syntactic, discourse, and reasoning tasks. While LLMs are increasingly deployed in many forms including conversational agents that interact with humans, we lack a grounded benchmark to measure how well LLMs understand social language. Here, we introduce a new theory-driven benchmark, SocKET, that contains 58 NLP tasks testing social knowledge which we group into five categories: humor & sarcasm, offensiveness, sentiment & emotion, and trustworthiness. In tests on the benchmark, we demonstrate that current models attain only moderate performance but reveal significant potential for task transfer among different types and categories of tasks, which were predicted from theory. Through zero-shot evaluations, we show that pretrained models already possess some innate but limited capabilities of social language understanding and training on one category of tasks can improve zero-shot testing on others. Our benchmark provides a systematic way to analyze model performance on an important dimension of language and points to clear room for improvement to build more socially-aware LLMs. The resources are released at https://github.com/minjechoi/SOCKET."
"The escalating debate on AI's capabilities warrants developing reliable metrics to assess machine ""intelligence"". Recently, many anecdotal examples were used to suggest that newer large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and GPT-4 exhibit Neural Theory-of-Mind (N-ToM); however, prior work reached conflicting conclusions regarding those abilities. We investigate the extent of LLMs' N-ToM through an extensive evaluation on 6 tasks and find that while LLMs exhibit certain N-ToM abilities, this behavior is far from being robust. We further examine the factors impacting performance on N-ToM tasks and discover that LLMs struggle with adversarial examples, indicating reliance on shallow heuristics rather than robust ToM abilities. We caution against drawing conclusions from anecdotal examples, limited benchmark testing, and using human-designed psychological tests to evaluate models."
"Emotions play a critical role in numerous processes, including, but not limited to, social interactions. Consequently, the ability to evoke and recognize emotions is a challenging task with widespread implications, notably in the field of mental health assessment systems. However, up until now, emotional elicitation methods have not utilized simulated open social conversations. Our study introduces a comprehensive Virtual Human (VH), equipped with a realistic avatar and conversational abilities based on a Large Language Model. This architecture integrates psychological constructs—such as personality, mood, and attitudes—with emotional facial expressions, lip synchronization, and voice synthesis. All these features are embedded into a modular, cognitively-inspired framework, specifically designed for voice-based semi-guided emotional conversations in real time. The validation process involved an experiment with 64 participants interacting with six distinct VHs, each designed to provoke a different basic emotion. The system took an average of 4.44 s to generate the VH's response. Participants assessed the naturalness and realism of the conversation, scoring averages of 4.61 and 4.44 out of 7, respectively. The VHs successfully generated the intended emotional valence in the users, while arousal was not evoked, though it could be recognized in the VHs. Our findings underscore the feasibility of employing VHs within affective computing to elicit emotions in socially and ecologically valid contexts. This development holds significant potential for application in sectors such as health, education, and marketing, among others."
"The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought both excitement and concerns to social computing research. On the one hand, LLMs offer unprecedented capabilities in analyzing vast amounts of textual data and generating human-like responses, enabling researchers to delve into complex social phenomena. On the other hand, concerns are emerging regarding the validity, privacy, and ethics of the research when LLMs are involved. This SIG aims at offering an open space for social computing researchers who are interested in understanding the impacts of LLMs to discuss their current practices, perspectives, challenges when engaging with LLMs in their everyday work and collectively shaping the emerging norms of using LLMs in social computing research."
"Suicidal ideation detection is a vital research area that holds great potential for improving mental health support systems. However, the sensitivity surrounding suicide-related data poses challenges in accessing large-scale, annotated datasets necessary for training effective machine learning models. To address this limitation, we introduce an innovative strategy that leverages the capabilities of generative AI models, such as ChatGPT, Flan-T5, and Llama, to create synthetic data for suicidal ideation detection. Our data generation approach is grounded in social factors extracted from psychology literature and aims to ensure coverage of essential information related to suicidal ideation. In our study, we benchmarked against state-of-the-art NLP classification models, specifically, those centered around the BERT family structures. When trained on the real-world dataset, UMD, these conventional models tend to yield F1-scores ranging from 0.75 to 0.87. Our synthetic data-driven method, informed by social factors, offers consistent F1-scores of 0.82 for both models, suggesting that the richness of topics in synthetic data can bridge the performance gap across different model complexities. Most impressively, when we combined a mere 30% of the UMD dataset with our synthetic data, we witnessed a substantial increase in performance, achieving an F1-score of 0.88 on the UMD test set. Such results underscore the cost-effectiveness and potential of our approach in confronting major challenges in the field, such as data scarcity and the quest for diversity in data representation."
"We propose augmenting the empathetic capacities of social robots by integrating non-verbal cues. Our primary contribution is the design and labeling of four types of empathetic non-verbal cues, abbreviated as SAFE: Speech, Action (gesture), Facial expression, and Emotion, in a social robot. These cues are generated using a Large Language Model (LLM). We developed an LLM-based conversational system for the robot and assessed its alignment with social cues as defined by human counselors. Preliminary results show distinct patterns in the robot's responses, such as a preference for calm and positive social emotions like 'joy' and 'lively', and frequent nodding gestures. Despite these tendencies, our approach has led to the development of a social robot capable of context-aware and more authentic interactions. Our work lays the groundwork for future studies on human-robot interactions, emphasizing the essential role of both verbal and non-verbal cues in creating social and empathetic robots."
"With the development of web technology, social media texts are becoming a rich source for automatic mental health analysis. As traditional discriminative methods bear the problem of low interpretability, the recent large language models have been explored for interpretable mental health analysis on social media, which aims to provide detailed explanations along with predictions. The results show that ChatGPT can generate approaching-human explanations for its correct classifications. However, LLMs still achieve unsatisfactory classification performance in a zero-shot/few-shot manner. Domain-specific finetuning is an effective solution, but faces 2 challenges: 1) lack of high-quality training data. 2) no open-source LLMs for interpretable mental health analysis were released to lower the finetuning cost. To alleviate these problems, we build the first multi-task and multi-source interpretable mental health instruction (IMHI) dataset on social media, with 105K data samples. The raw social media data are collected from 10 existing sources covering 8 mental health analysis tasks. We use expert-written few-shot prompts and collected labels to prompt ChatGPT and obtain explanations from its responses. To ensure the reliability of the explanations, we perform strict automatic and human evaluations on the correctness, consistency, and quality of generated data. Based on the IMHI dataset and LLaMA2 foundation models, we train MentalLLaMA, the first open-source LLM series for interpretable mental health analysis with instruction-following capability. We also evaluate the performance of MentalLLaMA on the IMHI evaluation benchmark with 10 test sets, where their correctness for making predictions and the quality of explanations are examined. The results show that MentalLLaMA approaches state-of-the-art discriminative methods in correctness and generates high-quality explanations."
"Social robots are making their way into our lives in different scenarios in which humans and robots need to communicate.In these scenarios, verbal communication is an essential element of human-robot interaction.However, in most cases, social robots' utterances are based on predefined texts, which can cause users to perceive the robots as repetitive and boring.Achieving natural and friendly communication is important for avoiding this scenario.To this end, we propose to apply state-of-the-art natural language generation models to provide our social robots with more diverse speech.In particular, we have implemented and evaluated two mechanisms: a paraphrasing module that transforms the robot's utterances while keeping their original meaning, and a module to generate speech about a certain topic that adapts the content of this speech to the robot's conversation partner.The results show that these models have great potential when applied to our social robots, but several limitations must be considered.These include the computational cost of the solutions presented, the latency that some of these models can introduce in the interaction, the use of proprietary models, or the lack of a subjective evaluation that complements the results of the tests conducted."
"Abstract Large language models (LLM) have been a catalyst for the public interest in artificial intelligence (AI). These technologies perform some knowledge-based tasks better and faster than human beings. However, whether AIs can correctly assess social situations and devise socially appropriate behavior, is still unclear. We conducted an established Situational Judgment Test (SJT) with five different chatbots and compared their results with responses of human participants ( N = 276). Claude, Copilot and you.com’s smart assistant performed significantly better than humans in proposing suitable behaviors in social situations. Moreover, their effectiveness rating of different behavior options aligned well with expert ratings. These results indicate that LLMs are capable of producing adept social judgments. While this constitutes an important requirement for the use as virtual social assistants, challenges and risks are still associated with their wide-spread use in social contexts."
"The capability of large language models (LLMs) to generate, debug, and explain code has sparked the interest of researchers and educators in undergraduate programming, with many anticipating their transformative potential in programming education. However, decisions about why and how to use LLMs in programming education may involve more than just the assessment of an LLM's technical capabilities. Using the social shaping of technology theory as a guiding framework, our study explores how students' social perceptions influence their own LLM usage. We then examine the correlation of self-reported LLM usage with students' self-efficacy and midterm performances in an undergraduate programming course. Triangulating data from an anonymous end-of-course student survey (n = 158), a mid-course self-efficacy survey (n=158), student interviews (n = 10), self-reported LLM usage on homework, and midterm performances, we discovered that students' use of LLMs was associated with their expectations for their future careers and their perceptions of peer usage. Additionally, early self-reported LLM usage in our context correlated with lower self-efficacy and lower midterm scores, while students' perceived over-reliance on LLMs, rather than their usage itself, correlated with decreased self-efficacy later in the course."
"The research publication, “Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior,” by Stanford and Google in 2023 established that large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 can generate interactive agents with credible and emergent human-like behaviors. However, their application in simulating human responses in cybersecurity scenarios, particularly in social engineering attacks, remains unexplored. In addressing that gap, this study explores the potential of LLMs, specifically the Open AI GPT-4 model, to simulate a broad spectrum of human responses to social engineering attacks that exploit human social behaviors, framing our primary research question: How does the simulated behavior of human targets, based on the Big Five personality traits, responds to social engineering attacks? . This study aims to provide valuable insights for organizations and researchers striving to systematically analyze human behavior and identify prevalent human qualities, as defined by the Big Five personality traits, that are susceptible to social engineering attacks, specifically phishing emails. Also, it intends to offer recommendations for the cybersecurity industry and policymakers on mitigating these risks. The findings indicate that LLMs can provide realistic simulations of human responses to social engineering attacks, highlighting certain personality traits as more susceptible."
"Depression harms. However, due to a lack of mental health awareness and fear of stigma, many patients do not actively seek diagnosis and treatment, leading to detrimental outcomes. Depression detection aims to determine whether an individual suffers from depression by analyzing their history of posts on social media, which can significantly aid in early detection and intervention. It mainly faces two key challenges: 1) it requires professional medical knowledge, and 2) it necessitates both high accuracy and explainability. To address it, we propose a novel depression detection system called DORIS, combining medical knowledge and the recent advances in large language models (LLMs). Specifically, to tackle the first challenge, we proposed an LLM-based solution to first annotate whether high-risk texts meet medical diagnostic criteria. Further, we retrieve texts with high emotional intensity and summarize critical information from the historical mood records of users, so-called mood courses. To tackle the second challenge, we combine LLM and traditional classifiers to integrate medical knowledge-guided features, for which the model can also explain its prediction results, achieving both high accuracy and explainability. Extensive experimental results on benchmarking datasets show that, compared to the current best baseline, our approach improves by 0.036 in AUPRC, which can be considered significant, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach and its high value as an NLP application."
"Social cognitive theory explains how people learn and acquire knowledge through observing others. Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), which suggests their potential significance as agents in the society. LLMs, as AI agents, can observe external information, which shapes their cognition and behaviors. However, the extent to which external information influences LLMs' cognition and behaviors remains unclear. This study investigates how external statements and opinions influence LLMs' thoughts and behaviors from a social cognitive perspective. Three experiments were conducted to explore the effects of external information on LLMs' memories, opinions, and social media behavioral decisions. Sociocognitive factors, including source authority, social identity, and social role, were analyzed to investigate their moderating effects. Results showed that external information can significantly shape LLMs' memories, opinions, and behaviors, with these changes mirroring human social cognitive patterns such as authority bias, in-group bias, emotional positivity, and emotion contagion. This underscores the challenges in developing safe and unbiased LLMs, and emphasizes the importance of understanding the susceptibility of LLMs to external influences."
"Abstract In the realm of social media, users frequently convey personal sentiments, with some potentially indicating cognitive distortions or suicidal tendencies. Timely recognition of such signs is pivotal for effective interventions. In response, we introduce two novel annotated datasets from Chinese social media, focused on cognitive distortions and suicidal risk classification. We propose a comprehensive benchmark using both supervised learning and large language models, especially from the GPT series, to evaluate performance on these datasets. To assess the capabilities of the large language models, we employed three strategies: zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning. Furthermore, we deeply explored and analyzed the performance of these large language models from a psychological perspective, shedding light on their strengths and limitations in identifying and understanding complex human emotions. Our evaluations underscore a performance difference between the two approaches, with the models often challenged by subtle category distinctions. While GPT-4 consistently delivered strong results, GPT-3.5 showed marked improvement in suicide risk classification after fine-tuning. This research is groundbreaking in its evaluation of large language models for Chinese social media tasks, accentuating the models' potential in psychological contexts. All datasets and code are made available at: \url{https://github.com/HongzhiQ/SupervisedVsLLM-EfficacyEval}."
"Large Language Models (LLMs) have democratized synthetic data generation, which in turn has the potential to simplify and broaden a wide gamut of NLP tasks. Here, we tackle a pervasive problem in synthetic data generation: its generative distribution often differs from the distribution of real-world data researchers care about (in other words, it is unfaithful). In a case study on sarcasm detection, we study three strategies to increase the faithfulness of synthetic data: grounding, filtering, and taxonomy-based generation. We evaluate these strategies using the performance of classifiers trained with generated synthetic data on real-world data. While all three strategies improve the performance of classifiers, we find that grounding works best for the task at hand. As synthetic data generation plays an ever-increasing role in NLP research, we expect this work to be a stepping stone in improving its utility. We conclude this paper with some recommendations on how to generate high(er)-fidelity synthetic data for specific tasks."
"Large language models (LLMs) not only learn natural text generation abilities but also social biases against different demographic groups from real-world data. This poses a critical risk when deploying LLM-based applications. Existing research and resources are not readily applicable in South Korea due to the differences in language and culture, both of which significantly affect the biases and targeted demographic groups. This limitation requires localized social bias datasets to ensure the safe and effective deployment of LLMs. To this end, we present KosBi, a new social bias dataset of 34k pairs of contexts and sentences in Korean covering 72 demographic groups in 15 categories. We find that through filtering-based moderation, social biases in generated content can be reduced by 16.47%p on average for HyperClova (30B and 82B), and GPT-3."
"As the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) emerge, they not only assist in accomplishing traditional tasks within more efficient paradigms but also stimulate the evolution of social bots. Researchers have begun exploring the implementation of LLMs as the driving core of social bots, enabling more efficient and user-friendly completion of tasks like profile completion, social behavior decision-making, and social content generation. However, there is currently a lack of systematic research on the behavioral characteristics of LLMs-driven social bots and their impact on social networks. We have curated data from Chirper, a Twitter-like social network populated by LLMs-driven social bots and embarked on an exploratory study. Our findings indicate that: (1) LLMs-driven social bots possess enhanced individual-level camouflage while exhibiting certain collective characteristics; (2) these bots have the ability to exert influence on online communities through toxic behaviors; (3) existing detection methods are applicable to the activity environment of LLMs-driven social bots but may be subject to certain limitations in effectiveness. Moreover, we have organized the data collected in our study into the Masquerade-23 dataset, which we have publicly released, thus addressing the data void in the subfield of LLMs-driven social bots behavior datasets. Our research outcomes provide primary insights for the research and governance of LLMs-driven social bots within the research community."
"In computational social science (CSS), researchers analyze documents to explain social and political phenomena. In most scenarios, CSS researchers first obtain labels for documents and then explain labels using interpretable regression analyses in the second step. One increasingly common way to annotate documents cheaply at scale is through large language models (LLMs). However, like other scalable ways of producing annotations, such surrogate labels are often imperfect and biased. We present a new algorithm for using imperfect annotation surrogates for downstream statistical analyses while guaranteeing statistical properties -- like asymptotic unbiasedness and proper uncertainty quantification -- which are fundamental to CSS research. We show that direct use of surrogate labels in downstream statistical analyses leads to substantial bias and invalid confidence intervals, even with high surrogate accuracy of 80-90%. To address this, we build on debiased machine learning to propose the design-based supervised learning (DSL) estimator. DSL employs a doubly-robust procedure to combine surrogate labels with a smaller number of high-quality, gold-standard labels. Our approach guarantees valid inference for downstream statistical analyses, even when surrogates are arbitrarily biased and without requiring stringent assumptions, by controlling the probability of sampling documents for gold-standard labeling. Both our theoretical analysis and experimental results show that DSL provides valid statistical inference while achieving root mean squared errors comparable to existing alternatives that focus only on prediction without inferential guarantees."
"Instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive language understanding and the capacity to generate responses that follow specific prompts. However, due to the computational demands associated with training these models, their applications often adopt a zero-shot setting. In this paper, we evaluate the zero-shot performance of two publicly accessible LLMs, ChatGPT and OpenAssistant, in the context of six Computational Social Science classification tasks, while also investigating the effects of various prompting strategies. Our experiments investigate the impact of prompt complexity, including the effect of incorporating label definitions into the prompt; use of synonyms for label names; and the influence of integrating past memories during foundation model training. The findings indicate that in a zero-shot setting, current LLMs are unable to match the performance of smaller, fine-tuned baseline transformer models (such as BERT-large). Additionally, we find that different prompting strategies can significantly affect classification accuracy, with variations in accuracy and F1 scores exceeding 10\%."
"As Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate increasingly human-like abilities in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks that are bound to become integral to personalized technologies, understanding their capabilities and inherent biases is crucial. Our study investigates the potential of LLMs like ChatGPT to infer psychological dispositions of individuals from their digital footprints. Specifically, we assess the ability of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to derive the Big Five personality traits from users' Facebook status updates in a zero-shot learning scenario. Our results show an average correlation of r = .29 (range = [.22, .33]) between LLM-inferred and self-reported trait scores. Furthermore, our findings suggest biases in personality inferences with regard to gender and age: inferred scores demonstrated smaller errors for women and younger individuals on several traits, suggesting a potential systematic bias stemming from the underlying training data or differences in online self-expression."
"Social media is often criticized for amplifying toxic discourse and discouraging constructive conversations. But designing social media platforms to promote better conversations is inherently challenging. This paper asks whether simulating social media through a combination of Large Language Models (LLM) and Agent-Based Modeling can help researchers study how different news feed algorithms shape the quality of online conversations. We create realistic personas using data from the American National Election Study to populate simulated social media platforms. Next, we prompt the agents to read and share news articles - and like or comment upon each other's messages - within three platforms that use different news feed algorithms. In the first platform, users see the most liked and commented posts from users whom they follow. In the second, they see posts from all users - even those outside their own network. The third platform employs a novel ""bridging"" algorithm that highlights posts that are liked by people with opposing political views. We find this bridging algorithm promotes more constructive, non-toxic, conversation across political divides than the other two models. Though further research is needed to evaluate these findings, we argue that LLMs hold considerable potential to improve simulation research on social media and many other complex social settings."

The popularity and breadth of use also put this technology in the position to fundamentally reshape how written language is perceived and evaluated. It is also the case that spoken language has long played a role in maintaining power and hegemony in society, especially through ideas of social identity and ``correct'' forms of language. But as human communication becomes even more reliant on text and writing, it is important to understand how these processes might shift and who is more likely to see their writing styles reflected back at them through modern AI. We therefore ask the following question: \textit{who} does generative AI write like? To answer this, we compare writing style features in over 150,000 college admissions essays submitted to a large public university system and an engineering program at an elite private university with a corpus of over 25,000 essays generated with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to the same writing prompts. We find that human-authored essays exhibit more variability across various individual writing style features (e.g., verb usage) than AI-generated essays. Overall, we find that the AI-generated essays are most similar to essays authored by students who are males with higher levels of social privilege. These findings demonstrate critical misalignments between human and AI authorship characteristics, which may affect the evaluation of writing and calls for research on control strategies to improve alignment."
"This study utilized large language models (LLMs) to analyze public sentiment in the United States (US) regarding nuclear power on social media, focusing on X/Twitter, considering climate change challenges and advancements in nuclear power technology. Approximately, 1.26 million nuclear tweets from 2008–2023 were examined to fine-tune LLMs for sentiment classification. We found the crucial role of accurate data labeling for model performance, with potential implications for a 15% improvement, achieved through high-confidence labels. LLMs demonstrated better performance compared to traditional machine learning classifiers, with reduced susceptibility to overfitting and up to 96% classification accuracy. LLMs are used to segment the US public tweets into policy and energy-related categories, revealing that 68% are politically themed. Policy tweets tended to convey negative sentiment, often reflecting opposing political perspectives and focusing on nuclear deals and international relations. Energy-related tweets covered diverse topics with predominantly neutral to positive sentiment, indicating broad support for nuclear power in 48 out of 50 US states. The US public positive sentiments toward nuclear power stemmed from its high power density, reliability regardless of weather conditions, environmental benefits, application versatility, and recent innovations and advancements in both fission and fusion technologies. Negative sentiments primarily focused on waste management, high capital costs, and safety concerns. The neutral campaign highlighted global nuclear facts and advancements, with varying tones leaning towards positivity or negativity. An interesting neutral theme was the advocacy for the combined use of renewable and nuclear energy to attain net-zero goals."
"Social media influence campaigns pose significant challenges to public discourse and democracy. Traditional detection methods fall short due to the complexity and dynamic nature of social media. Addressing this, we propose a novel detection method using Large Language Models (LLMs) that incorporates both user metadata and network structures. By converting these elements into a text format, our approach effectively processes multilingual content and adapts to the shifting tactics of malicious campaign actors. We validate our model through rigorous testing on multiple datasets, showcasing its superior performance in identifying influence efforts. This research not only offers a powerful tool for detecting campaigns, but also sets the stage for future enhancements to keep up with the fast-paced evolution of social media-based influence tactics."
"In an era where the silent struggle of underdiagnosed depression pervades globally, our research delves into the crucial link between mental health and social media. This work focuses on early detection of depression, particularly in extroverted social media users, using LLMs such as GPT 3.5, GPT 4 and our proposed GPT 3.5 fine-tuned model DepGPT, as well as advanced Deep learning models(LSTM, Bi-LSTM, GRU, BiGRU) and Transformer models(BERT, BanglaBERT, SahajBERT, BanglaBERT-Base). The study categorized Reddit and X datasets into ""Depressive"" and ""Non-Depressive"" segments, translated into Bengali by native speakers with expertise in mental health, resulting in the creation of the Bengali Social Media Depressive Dataset (BSMDD). Our work provides full architecture details for each model and a methodical way to assess their performance in Bengali depressive text categorization using zero-shot and few-shot learning techniques. Our work demonstrates the superiority of SahajBERT and Bi-LSTM with FastText embeddings in their respective domains also tackles explainability issues with transformer models and emphasizes the effectiveness of LLMs, especially DepGPT (GPT 3.5 fine-tuned), demonstrating flexibility and competence in a range of learning contexts. According to the experiment results, the proposed model, DepGPT, outperformed not only Alpaca Lora 7B in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios but also every other model, achieving a near-perfect accuracy of 0.9796 and an F1-score of 0.9804, high recall, and exceptional precision. Although competitive, GPT-3.5 Turbo and Alpaca Lora 7B show relatively poorer effectiveness in zero-shot and few-shot situations. The work emphasizes the effectiveness and flexibility of LLMs in a variety of linguistic circumstances, providing insightful information about the complex field of depression detection models."
"I write these lines not as an expert in LLMs, but more as an informed user. I did my PhD on the application of early transformers-based language models (e.g. BERT, RoBERTa) to classify large amounts of text data. I have experience with their ``fine-tuning"" process and a reasonable amount of knowledge about their training process. However, NLP technology has progressed fast and in a couple of years we moved from models containing hundreds of millions of parameters, to models containing hundreds of billions of parameters. Large Language Models keep getting larger and more capable. Companies closely related to the work of social scientists are taking note of this and they are starting to offer “AI-powered” qualitative software (e.g., see AtlasTi new OpenAI alliance) opening exciting new avenues for social scientists.However, I believe that while the technical capabilities of the models have progressed fast, our actual understanding of what they are and what they are actually capable of doing has been, maybe purposely, left behind. There are several misconceptions about the models' “reasoning” and “introspection” capabilities, with claims pointing towards a soon-to-be-achieved ""Artificial General Intelligence"" (AGI), a holy grail of the research in artificial intelligence, but without offering substantial evidence of such claims. There is also the incredibly thick jargon used in the AI and Machine Learning community, ---which I’m more than guilty of using---, which, sometimes purposely, contributes to gate-keep the knowledge and details of this new to technologies to a reduce group of individuals. Finally, there is a fair amount of marketing strategy around the communications related to LLMs. Most of the newest Large Language Models are the intellectual property and product of large companies and corporations, as they are too big and costly to be trained by singular individuals. For these corporations, being seen by the general public as producing real “Artificial General Intelligence” or “Reasoning Machines” is a big selling point, although the reality might be much more nuanced than that.All of this contributes to generate confusion and mystification around AI, in general, and Large Language Models in particular. So, in a personal effort to clear-up my own thoughts and to hopefully provide something useful for others, in this document I will attempt to provide a high-level description of what LLMs are, how they work and what they are capable of doing, especially for social scientists."
"The assessment of social determinants of health (SDoH) within healthcare systems is crucial for comprehensive patient care and addressing health disparities. Current challenges arise from the limited inclusion of structured SDoH information within electronic health record (EHR) systems, often due to the lack of standardized diagnosis codes. This study delves into the transformative potential of large language models (LLM) to overcome these challenges. LLM-based classifiers—using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa)—were developed for SDoH concepts, including homelessness, food insecurity, and domestic violence, using synthetic training datasets generated by generative pre-trained transformers combined with authentic clinical notes. Models were then validated on separate datasets: Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III and our institutional EHR data. When training the model with a combination of synthetic and authentic notes, validation on our institutional dataset yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.78 for detecting homelessness, 0.72 for detecting food insecurity, and 0.83 for detecting domestic violence. This study underscores the potential of LLMs in extracting SDoH information from clinical text. Automated detection of SDoH may be instrumental for healthcare providers in identifying at-risk patients, guiding targeted interventions, and contributing to population health initiatives aimed at mitigating disparities."
"Large language models (LLMs) are becoming pervasive in everyday life, yet their propensity to reproduce biases inherited from training data remains a pressing concern. Prior investigations into bias in LLMs have focused on the association of social groups with stereotypical attributes. However, this is only one form of human bias such systems may reproduce. We investigate a new form of bias in LLMs that resembles a social psychological phenomenon where socially subordinate groups are perceived as more homogeneous than socially dominant groups. We had ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art LLM, generate texts about intersectional group identities and compared those texts on measures of homogeneity. We consistently found that ChatGPT portrayed African, Asian, and Hispanic Americans as more homogeneous than White Americans, indicating that the model described racial minority groups with a narrower range of human experience. ChatGPT also portrayed women as more homogeneous than men, but these differences were small. Finally, we found that the effect of gender differed across racial/ethnic groups such that the effect of gender was consistent within African and Hispanic Americans but not within Asian and White Americans. We argue that the tendency of LLMs to describe groups as less diverse risks perpetuating stereotypes and discriminatory behavior."
"Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming the way people generate, explore, and engage with content. We study how we can develop LLM applications for online social networks. Despite LLMs' successes in other domains, it is challenging to develop LLM-based products for social networks for numerous reasons, and it has been relatively under-reported in the research community. We categorize LLM applications for social networks into three categories. First is knowledge tasks where users want to find new knowledge and information, such as search and question-answering. Second is entertainment tasks where users want to consume interesting content, such as getting entertaining notification content. Third is foundational tasks that need to be done to moderate and operate the social networks, such as content annotation and LLM monitoring. For each task, we share the challenges we found, solutions we developed, and lessons we learned. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive paper about developing LLM applications for social networks."
"The BigScience Workshop was a value-driven initiative that spanned one and half years of interdisciplinary research and culminated in the creation of ROOTS, a 1.6TB multilingual dataset that was used to train BLOOM, one of the largest multilingual language models to date. In addition to the technical outcomes and artifacts, the workshop fostered multidisciplinary collaborations around large models, datasets, and their analysis. This in turn led to a wide range of research publications spanning topics from ethics to law, data governance, modeling choices and distributed training. This paper focuses on the collaborative research aspects of BigScience and takes a step back to look at the challenges of large-scale participatory research, with respect to participant diversity and the tasks required to successfully carry out such a project. Our main goal is to share the lessons we learned from this experience, what we could have done better and what we did well. We show how the impact of such a social approach to scientific research goes well beyond the technical artifacts that were the basis of its inception."
"Studies have shown that large pretrained language models exhibit biases against social groups based on race, gender etc, which they inherit from the datasets they are trained on. Various researchers have proposed mathematical tools for quantifying and identifying these biases. There have been methods proposed to mitigate such biases. In this paper, we present a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of different kinds of biases such as race, gender, ethnicity, age etc. exhibited by popular pretrained language models such as BERT, GPT-2 etc. and also present a toolkit that provides plug-and-play interfaces to connect mathematical tools to identify biases with large pretrained language models such as BERT, GPT-2 etc. and also present users with the opportunity to test custom models against these metrics. The toolkit also allows users to debias existing and custom models using the debiasing techniques proposed so far. The toolkit is available at https://github.com/HrishikeshVish/Fairpy."
"Large language models (LLMs) learn not only natural text generation abilities but also social biases against different demographic groups from real-world data. This poses a critical risk when deploying LLM-based applications. Existing research and resources are not readily applicable in South Korea due to the differences in language and culture, both of which significantly affect the biases and targeted demographic groups. This limitation requires localized social bias datasets to ensure the safe and effective deployment of LLMs. To this end, we present KO SB I, a new social bias dataset of 34k pairs of contexts and sentences in Korean covering 72 demographic groups in 15 categories. We find that through filtering-based moderation, social biases in generated content can be reduced by 16.47%p on average for HyperCLOVA (30B and 82B), and GPT-3."
"Abstract Large language models (LLMs) are becoming more widely used to simulate human participants and so understanding their biases is important. We developed an experimental framework using Big Five personality surveys and uncovered a previously undetected social desirability bias in a wide range of LLMs. By systematically varying the number of questions LLMs were exposed to, we demonstrate their ability to infer when they are being evaluated. When personality evaluation is inferred, LLMs skew their scores towards the desirable ends of trait dimensions (i.e. increased extraversion, decreased neuroticism, etc.). This bias exists in all tested models, including GPT-4/3.5, Claude 3, Llama 3, and PaLM-2. Bias levels appear to increase in more recent models, with GPT-4’s survey responses changing by 1.20 (human) SD and Llama 3’s by 0.98 SD, which are very large effects. This bias remains after question order randomization and paraphrasing. Reverse coding the questions decreases bias levels but does not eliminate them, suggesting that this effect cannot be attributed to acquiescence bias. Our findings reveal an emergent social desirability bias and suggest constraints on profiling LLMs with psychometric tests and on this use of LLMs as proxies for human participants."
"The consistent and persuasive evidence illustrating the influence of social determinants on health has prompted a growing realization throughout the health care sector that enhancing health and health equity will likely depend, at least to some extent, on addressing detrimental social determinants. However, detailed social determinants of health (SDoH) information is often buried within clinical narrative text in electronic health records (EHRs), necessitating natural language processing (NLP) methods to automatically extract these details. Most current NLP efforts for SDoH extraction have been limited, investigating on limited types of SDoH elements, deriving data from a single institution, focusing on specific patient cohorts or note types, with reduced focus on generalizability. This study aims to address these issues by creating cross-institutional corpora spanning different note types and healthcare systems, and developing and evaluating the generalizability of classification models, including novel large language models (LLMs), for detecting SDoH factors from diverse types of notes from four institutions: Harris County Psychiatric Center, University of Texas Physician Practice, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and Mayo Clinic. Four corpora of deidentified clinical notes were annotated with 21 SDoH factors at two levels: level 1 with SDoH factor types only and level 2 with SDoH factors along with associated values. Three traditional classification algorithms (XGBoost, TextCNN, Sentence BERT) and an instruction tuned LLM-based approach (LLaMA) were developed to identify multiple SDoH factors. Substantial variation was noted in SDoH documentation practices and label distributions based on patient cohorts, note types, and hospitals. The LLM achieved top performance with micro-averaged F1 scores over 0.9 on level 1 annotated corpora and an F1 over 0.84 on level 2 annotated corpora. While models performed well when trained and tested on individual datasets, cross-dataset generalization highlighted remaining obstacles. To foster collaboration, access to partial annotated corpora and models trained by merging all annotated datasets will be made available on the PhysioNet repository."
"Abstract Objectives Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. This study aimed to evaluate their performances on social media-based health-related text classification tasks. Materials and Methods We benchmarked 1 Support Vector Machine (SVM), 3 supervised pretrained language models (PLMs), and 2 LLMs-based classifiers across 6 text classification tasks. We developed 3 approaches for leveraging LLMs: employing LLMs as zero-shot classifiers, using LLMs as data annotators, and utilizing LLMs with few-shot examples for data augmentation. Results Across all tasks, the mean (SD) F1 score differences for RoBERTa, BERTweet, and SocBERT trained on human-annotated data were 0.24 (±0.10), 0.25 (±0.11), and 0.23 (±0.11), respectively, compared to those trained on the data annotated using GPT3.5, and were 0.16 (±0.07), 0.16 (±0.08), and 0.14 (±0.08) using GPT4, respectively. The GPT3.5 and GPT4 zero-shot classifiers outperformed SVMs in a single task and in 5 out of 6 tasks, respectively. When leveraging LLMs for data augmentation, the RoBERTa models trained on GPT4-augmented data demonstrated superior or comparable performance compared to those trained on human-annotated data alone. Discussion The results revealed that using LLM-annotated data only for training supervised classification models was ineffective. However, employing the LLM as a zero-shot classifier exhibited the potential to outperform traditional SVM models and achieved a higher recall than the advanced transformer-based model RoBERTa. Additionally, our results indicated that utilizing GPT3.5 for data augmentation could potentially harm model performance. In contrast, data augmentation with GPT4 demonstrated improved model performances, showcasing the potential of LLMs in reducing the need for extensive training data. Conclusions By leveraging the data augmentation strategy, we can harness the power of LLMs to develop smaller, more effective domain-specific NLP models. Using LLM-annotated data without human guidance for training lightweight supervised classification models is an ineffective strategy. However, LLM, as a zero-shot classifier, shows promise in excluding false negatives and potentially reducing the human effort required for data annotation."
"Research on energy and society often relies on online data collection. In particular, there has been an increase in the use of online techniques such as video software for qualitative research since the pandemic. We suggest that the rapid growth in generative AI and Large Language Models such as Chat-GPT mean that they may be utilised by research participants; particularly in research where participants may be less knowledgeable about the topic under discussion, such as emerging energy technologies. Drawing on examples from recent research, we argue that social scientists need to be cautious in assuming that the voices of our participants are genuinely theirs."
"In this work, we investigate to use Large Language Models (LLMs) for rumor detection on social media. However, it is challenging for LLMs to reason over the entire propagation information on social media, which contains news contents and numerous comments, due to LLMs may not concentrate on key clues in the complex propagation information, and have trouble in reasoning when facing massive and redundant information. Accordingly, we propose an LLM-empowered Rumor Detection (LeRuD) approach, in which we design prompts to teach LLMs to reason over important clues in news and comments, and divide the entire propagation information into a Chain-of-Propagation for reducing LLMs' burden. We conduct extensive experiments on the Twitter and Weibo datasets, and LeRuD outperforms several state-of-the-art rumor detection models by 2.4% to 7.6%. Meanwhile, by applying LLMs, LeRuD requires no data for training, and thus shows more promising rumor detection ability in few-shot or zero-shot scenarios."
"Abstract Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have given rise to chatbots based on Large Language Models (LLMs) - such as ChatGPT - that can provide human-like responses to a wide range of psychological and economic tasks. However, no study to date has explored whether a society of LLM-based agents behaves comparably to human societies. We conduct Social Network Analysis on Chirper.ai, a Twitter-like platform consisting only of LLM chatbots. We find early evidence of self-organized homophily in the sampled artificial society ( N = 31,764): like humans, bots with similar language and content engage more than dissimilar bots. However, content created by the bots tends to be more generic than human-generated content. We discuss the potential for developing LLM-driven Agent-Based Models of human societies, which may inform AI research and development and further the social scientific understanding of human social dynamics."
"People rely on social skills like conflict resolution to communicate effectively and to thrive in both work and personal life. However, practice environments for social skills are typically out of reach for most people. How can we make social skill training more available, accessible, and inviting? Drawing upon interdisciplinary research from communication and psychology, this perspective paper identifies social skill barriers to enter specialized fields. Then we present a solution that leverages large language models for social skill training via a generic framework. Our AI Partner, AI Mentor framework merges experiential learning with realistic practice and tailored feedback. This work ultimately calls for cross-disciplinary innovation to address the broader implications for workforce development and social equality."
"Large neural network-based language models play an increasingly important role in contemporary AI. Although these models demonstrate sophisticated text generation capabilities, they have also been shown to reproduce harmful social biases contained in their training data. This paper presents a project that guides students through an exploration of social biases in large language models. As a final project for an intermediate college course in Artificial Intelligence, students developed a bias probe task for a previously-unstudied aspect of sociolinguistic or sociocultural bias they were interested in exploring. Through the process of constructing a dataset and evaluation metric to measure bias, students mastered key technical concepts, including how to run contemporary neural networks for natural language processing tasks; construct datasets and evaluation metrics; and analyze experimental results. Students reported their findings in an in-class presentation and a final report, recounting patterns of predictions that surprised, unsettled, and sparked interest in advocating for technology that reflects a more diverse set of backgrounds and experiences. Through this project, students engage with and even contribute to a growing body of scholarly work on social biases in large language models."
"Social network simulation plays a crucial role in addressing various challenges within social science. It offers extensive applications such as state prediction, phenomena explanation, and policy-making support, among others. In this work, we harness the formidable human-like capabilities exhibited by large language models (LLMs) in sensing, reasoning, and behaving, and utilize these qualities to construct the S$^3$ system (short for $\textbf{S}$ocial network $\textbf{S}$imulation $\textbf{S}$ystem). Adhering to the widely employed agent-based simulation paradigm, we employ prompt engineering and prompt tuning techniques to ensure that the agent's behavior closely emulates that of a genuine human within the social network. Specifically, we simulate three pivotal aspects: emotion, attitude, and interaction behaviors. By endowing the agent in the system with the ability to perceive the informational environment and emulate human actions, we observe the emergence of population-level phenomena, including the propagation of information, attitudes, and emotions. We conduct an evaluation encompassing two levels of simulation, employing real-world social network data. Encouragingly, the results demonstrate promising accuracy. This work represents an initial step in the realm of social network simulation empowered by LLM-based agents. We anticipate that our endeavors will serve as a source of inspiration for the development of simulation systems within, but not limited to, social science."
"Large language models (LLMs) require well-crafted prompts for effective use. Prompt engineering, the process of designing prompts, is challenging, particularly for non-experts who are less familiar with AI technologies. While researchers have proposed techniques and tools to assist LLM users in prompt design, these works primarily target AI application developers rather than non-experts. To address this research gap, we propose social prompt engineering, a novel paradigm that leverages social computing techniques to facilitate collaborative prompt design. To investigate social prompt engineering, we introduce Wordflow, an open-source and social text editor that enables everyday users to easily create, run, share, and discover LLM prompts. Additionally, by leveraging modern web technologies, Wordflow allows users to run LLMs locally and privately in their browsers. Two usage scenarios highlight how social prompt engineering and our tool can enhance laypeople's interaction with LLMs. Wordflow is publicly accessible at https://poloclub.github.io/wordflow."
"Abstract In this work, we describe our approach to developing an intelligent and robust social robotic system for the Nadine social robot platform. We achieve this by integrating large language models (LLMs) and skillfully leveraging the powerful reasoning and instruction‐following capabilities of these types of models to achieve advanced human‐like affective and cognitive capabilities. This approach is novel compared to the current state‐of‐the‐art LLM‐based agents which do not implement human‐like long‐term memory or sophisticated emotional capabilities. We built a social robot system that enables generating appropriate behaviors through multimodal input processing, bringing episodic memories accordingly to the recognized user, and simulating the emotional states of the robot induced by the interaction with the human partner. In particular, we introduce an LLM‐agent frame for social robots, social robotics reasoning and acting, serving as a core component for the interaction module in our system. This design has brought forth the advancement of social robots and aims to increase the quality of human–robot interaction."
"The problematic use of social media has numerous negative impacts on individuals' daily lives, interpersonal relationships, physical and mental health, and more. Currently, there are few methods and tools to alleviate problematic social media, and their potential is yet to be fully realized. Emerging large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly popular for providing information and assistance to people and are being applied in many aspects of life. In mitigating problematic social media use, LLMs such as ChatGPT can play a positive role by serving as conversational partners and outlets for users, providing personalized information and resources, monitoring and intervening in problematic social media use, and more. In this process, we should recognize both the enormous potential and endless possibilities of LLMs such as ChatGPT, leveraging their advantages to better address problematic social media use, while also acknowledging the limitations and potential pitfalls of ChatGPT technology, such as errors, limitations in issue resolution, privacy and security concerns, and potential overreliance. When we leverage the advantages of LLMs to address issues in social media usage, we must adopt a cautious and ethical approach, being vigilant of the potential adverse effects that LLMs may have in addressing problematic social media use to better harness technology to serve individuals and society."
"We introduce a multi-step reasoning framework using prompt-based LLMs to examine the relationship between social media language patterns and trends in national health outcomes. Grounded in fuzzy-trace theory, which emphasizes the importance of ""gists"" of causal coherence in effective health communication, we introduce Role-Based Incremental Coaching (RBIC), a prompt-based LLM framework, to identify gists at-scale. Using RBIC, we systematically extract gists from subreddit discussions opposing COVID-19 health measures (Study 1). We then track how these gists evolve across key events (Study 2) and assess their influence on online engagement (Study 3). Finally, we investigate how the volume of gists is associated with national health trends like vaccine uptake and hospitalizations (Study 4). Our work is the first to empirically link social media linguistic patterns to real-world public health trends, highlighting the potential of prompt-based LLMs in identifying critical online discussion patterns that can form the basis of public health communication strategies."
"The emergence of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude offers significant potential for the social work profession.However, these LLMs are not without their ethical and practical challenges, particularly concerning the accuracy of the information provided by these models.This commentary explores the importance of developing digital literacy among Forum: The Limitations of Large Language Models and Emerging Correctives to Support Social Work Scholarship: Selecting the Right Tool for the Task"
"Scale-free networks are one of the most famous examples of emergent behavior and are ubiquitous in social systems, especially online social media in which users can follow each other. By analyzing the interactions of multiple generative agents using GPT3.5-turbo as a language model, we demonstrate their ability to not only mimic individual human linguistic behavior but also exhibit collective phenomena intrinsic to human societies, in particular the emergence of scale-free networks. We discovered that this process is disrupted by a skewed token prior distribution of GPT3.5-turbo, which can lead to networks with extreme centralization as a kind of alignment. We show how renaming agents removes these token priors and allows the model to generate a range of networks from random networks to more realistic scale-free networks."
"Vaccination has engendered a spectrum of public opinions, with social media acting as a crucial platform for health-related discussions. The emergence of artificial intelligence technologies, such as large language models (LLMs), offers a novel opportunity to efficiently investigate public discourses. This research assesses the accuracy of ChatGPT, a widely used and freely available service built upon an LLM, for sentiment analysis to discern different stances toward Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination."
"Abstract Health risks due to preventable infections such as human papillomavirus (HPV) are exacerbated by persistent vaccine hesitancy. Due to limited sample sizes and the time needed to roll out, traditional methodologies like surveys and interviews offer restricted insights into quickly evolving vaccine concerns. Social media platforms can serve as fertile ground for monitoring vaccine-related conversations and detecting emerging concerns in a scalable and dynamic manner. Using state-of-the-art large language models, we propose a minimally supervised end-to-end approach to identify concerns against HPV vaccination from social media posts. We detect and characterize the concerns against HPV vaccination pre- and post-2020 to understand the evolution of HPV vaccine discourse. Upon analyzing 653 k HPV-related post-2020 tweets, adverse effects, personal anecdotes, and vaccine mandates emerged as the dominant themes. Compared to pre-2020, there is a shift towards personal anecdotes of vaccine injury with a growing call for parental consent and transparency. The proposed approach provides an end-to-end system, i.e. given a collection of tweets, a list of prevalent concerns is returned, providing critical insights for crafting targeted interventions, debunking messages, and informing public health campaigns."
"Real-time disaster-induced human fatality information is critical for rapid and accurate disaster impact and loss estimation and effective emergency response. Systems like PAGER incorporate online reported death tolls and loss projection models trained on significant historical earthquake events and ground shaking data to provide projected final seismic loss estimations. However, the input reported death toll data are mainly retrieved from news platforms manually, which is time-consuming and may have a large time bias. In recent years, platforms such as Facebook and Twitter have become hot spots for witness reporting and communication during disaster events, producing large volumes of immediate fatality information without the hindrances of official channels. Though lucrative, social media data is very noisy both in syntax and accuracy, necessitating robust solutions. In this work, we design and deploy a new online system that automatically extracts near-realtime multi-lingual human fatality information including death tolls and injury tolls, from a variety of information sources immediately after an earthquake occurs. Past studies have proposed to use popular machine learning methods such as SVMs, CNNs and Logistic Regression in conjunction with word embeddings to classify the relevancy of each social media message. However, these techniques suffer from impeding requirements of annotated data, which are unavailable at the onset of natural disasters, and cannot directly extract disaster information, instead relying on statistical analysis on their classification results. To address such challenges, we propose a Large Language Model-based approach that leverages its robust language understanding and few-shot learning abilities. In combination with our novel multilingual Hierarchical Event Classifier, another contribution, we achieve effective automatic earthquake casualty information retrieval from social media, which we test by deploying our framework to two recent earthquakes."
"Abstract Background The prevalence of obesity has been increasing worldwide, with substantial implications for public health. Obesity is independently associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and is estimated to cost the health system over $200 billion dollars annually. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have emerged as a practice-changing therapy for weight loss and cardiovascular risk reduction independent of diabetes. Methods We used large language models to augment our previously reported artificial intelligence-enabled topic modeling pipeline to analyze over 390,000 unique GLP-1 RA-related Reddit discussions. Results We find high interest around GLP-1 RAs, with a total of 168 topics and 33 groups focused on the GLP-1 RA experience with weight loss, comparison of side effects between differing GLP-1 RAs and alternate therapies, issues with GLP-1 RA access and supply, and the positive psychological benefits of GLP-1 RAs and associated weight loss. Notably, public sentiment in these discussions was mostly neutral-to-positive. Conclusions These findings have important implications for monitoring new side effects not captured in randomized control trials and understanding the public health challenge of drug shortages."
"Manually analyzing public health-related content from social media provides valuable insights into the beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors of individuals, shedding light on trends and patterns that can inform public understanding, policy decisions, targeted interventions, and communication strategies. Unfortunately, the time and effort needed from well-trained human subject matter experts makes extensive manual social media listening unfeasible. Generative large language models (LLMs) can potentially summarize and interpret large amounts of text, but it is unclear to what extent LLMs can glean subtle health-related meanings in large sets of social media posts and reasonably report health-related themes."
"Socially assistive robots (SARs) have shown great success in providing personalized cognitive-affective support for user populations with special needs such as older adults, children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and individuals with mental health challenges. The large body of work on SAR demonstrates its potential to provide at-home support that complements clinic-based interventions delivered by mental health professionals, making these interventions more effective and accessible. However, there are still several major technical challenges that hinder SAR-mediated interactions and interventions from reaching human-level social intelligence and efficacy. With the recent advances in large language models (LLMs), there is an increased potential for novel applications within the field of SAR that can significantly expand the current capabilities of SARs. However, incorporating LLMs introduces new risks and ethical concerns that have not yet been encountered, and must be carefully be addressed to safely deploy these more advanced systems. In this work, we aim to conduct a brief survey on the use of LLMs in SAR technologies, and discuss the potentials and risks of applying LLMs to the following three major technical challenges of SAR: 1) natural language dialog; 2) multimodal understanding; 3) LLMs as robot policies."
"Stance detection, a key task in natural language processing, determines an author's viewpoint based on textual analysis. This study evaluates the evolution of stance detection methods, transitioning from early machine learning approaches to the groundbreaking BERT model, and eventually to modern Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, LLaMa-2, and Mistral-7B. While ChatGPT's closed-source nature and associated costs present challenges, the open-source models like LLaMa-2 and Mistral-7B offers an encouraging alternative. Initially, our research focused on fine-tuning ChatGPT, LLaMa-2, and Mistral-7B using several publicly available datasets. Subsequently, to provide a comprehensive comparison, we assess the performance of these models in zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios. The results underscore the exceptional ability of LLMs in accurately detecting stance, with all tested models surpassing existing benchmarks. Notably, LLaMa-2 and Mistral-7B demonstrate remarkable efficiency and potential for stance detection, despite their smaller sizes compared to ChatGPT. This study emphasizes the potential of LLMs in stance detection and calls for more extensive research in this field."
"Background Social determinants of health (SDoH) such as housing insecurity are known to be intricately linked to patients’ health status. More efficient methods for abstracting structured data on SDoH can help accelerate the inclusion of exposome variables in biomedical research and support health care systems in identifying patients who could benefit from proactive outreach. Large language models (LLMs) developed from Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) have shown potential for performing complex abstraction tasks on unstructured clinical notes. Objective Here, we assess the performance of GPTs on identifying temporal aspects of housing insecurity and compare results between both original and deidentified notes. Methods We compared the ability of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to identify instances of both current and past housing instability, as well as general housing status, from 25,217 notes from 795 pregnant women. Results were compared with manual abstraction, a named entity recognition model, and regular expressions. Results Compared with GPT-3.5 and the named entity recognition model, GPT-4 had the highest performance and had a much higher recall (0.924) than human abstractors (0.702) in identifying patients experiencing current or past housing instability, although precision was lower (0.850) compared with human abstractors (0.971). GPT-4’s precision improved slightly (0.936 original, 0.939 deidentified) on deidentified versions of the same notes, while recall dropped (0.781 original, 0.704 deidentified). Conclusions This work demonstrates that while manual abstraction is likely to yield slightly more accurate results overall, LLMs can provide a scalable, cost-effective solution with the advantage of greater recall. This could support semiautomated abstraction, but given the potential risk for harm, human review would be essential before using results for any patient engagement or care decisions. Furthermore, recall was lower when notes were deidentified prior to LLM abstraction."
"Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values is imperative to mitigate potential adverse effects resulting from their misuse. Drawing from the sociological insight that acknowledging all parties' concerns is a key factor in shaping human values, this paper proposes a novel direction to align LLMs by themselves: social scene simulation. To achieve this, we present MATRIX, a novel social scene simulator that emulates realistic scenes around a user's input query, enabling the LLM to take social consequences into account before responding. MATRIX serves as a virtual rehearsal space, akin to a Monopolylogue, where the LLM performs diverse roles related to the query and practice by itself. To inject this alignment, we fine-tune the LLM with MATRIX-simulated data, ensuring adherence to human values without compromising inference speed. We theoretically show that the LLM with MATRIX outperforms Constitutional AI under mild assumptions. Finally, extensive experiments validate that our method outperforms over 10 baselines across 4 benchmarks. As evidenced by 875 user ratings, our tuned 13B-size LLM exceeds GPT-4 in aligning with human values. Code is available at https://github.com/pangxianghe/MATRIX."
"As Large Language Models (LLMs) become widely used to model and simulate human behavior, understanding their biases becomes critical. We developed an experimental framework using Big Five personality surveys and uncovered a previously undetected social desirability bias in a wide range of LLMs. By systematically varying the number of questions LLMs were exposed to, we demonstrate their ability to infer when they are being evaluated. When personality evaluation is inferred, LLMs skew their scores towards the desirable ends of trait dimensions (i.e., increased extraversion, decreased neuroticism, etc). This bias exists in all tested models, including GPT-4/3.5, Claude 3, Llama 3, and PaLM-2. Bias levels appear to increase in more recent models, with GPT-4's survey responses changing by 1.20 (human) standard deviations and Llama 3's by 0.98 standard deviations-very large effects. This bias is robust to randomization of question order and paraphrasing. Reverse-coding all the questions decreases bias levels but does not eliminate them, suggesting that this effect cannot be attributed to acquiescence bias. Our findings reveal an emergent social desirability bias and suggest constraints on profiling LLMs with psychometric tests and on using LLMs as proxies for human participants."
"Qualitative methods like interviews produce richer data in comparison with quantitative surveys, but are difficult to scale. Switching from web-based questionnaires to interactive chatbots offers a compromise, improving user engagement and response quality. Uptake remains limited, however, because of differences in users' expectations versus the capabilities of natural language processing methods. In this study, we evaluate the potential of large language models (LLMs) to support an information elicitation chatbot that narrows this ""gulf of expectations"" (Luger & Sellen 2016). We conduct a user study in which participants (N = 399) were randomly assigned to interact with a rule-based chatbot versus one of two LLM-augmented chatbots. We observe limited evidence of differences in user engagement or response richness between conditions. However, the addition of LLM-based dynamic probing skills produces significant improvements in both quantitative and qualitative measures of user experience, consistent with a narrowing of the expectations gulf."
"Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to perform well at a variety of syntactic, discourse, and reasoning tasks. While LLMs are increasingly deployed in many forms including conversational agents that interact with humans, we lack a grounded benchmark to measure how well LLMs understand \textit{social} language. Here, we introduce a new theory-driven benchmark, SocKET, that contains 58 NLP tasks testing social knowledge which we group into five categories: humor & sarcasm, offensiveness, sentiment & emotion, and trustworthiness. In tests on the benchmark, we demonstrate that current models attain only moderate performance but reveal significant potential for task transfer among different types and categories of tasks, which were predicted from theory. Through zero-shot evaluations, we show that pretrained models already possess some innate but limited capabilities of social language understanding and training on one category of tasks can improve zero-shot testing on others. Our benchmark provides a systematic way to analyze model performance on an important dimension of language and points to clear room for improvement to build more socially-aware LLMs. The associated resources are released at https://github.com/minjechoi/SOCKET."
"Hypothesis formulation and testing are central to empirical research. A strong hypothesis is a best guess based on existing evidence and informed by a comprehensive view of relevant literature. However, with exponential increase in the number of scientific articles published annually, manual aggregation and synthesis of evidence related to a given hypothesis is a challenge. Our work explores the ability of current large language models (LLMs) to discern evidence in support or refute of specific hypotheses based on the text of scientific abstracts. We share a novel dataset for the task of scientific hypothesis evidencing using community-driven annotations of studies in the social sciences. We compare the performance of LLMs to several state-of-the-art benchmarks and highlight opportunities for future research in this area. The dataset is available at https://github.com/Sai90000/ScientificHypothesisEvidencing.git"
"Abstract Health-related social media data generated by patients and the public provide valuable insights into patient experiences and opinions toward health issues such as vaccination and medical treatments. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to analyze such data, however, often requires high-quality annotations that are difficult to obtain. The recent emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as the Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs) has shown promising performance on a variety of NLP tasks in the health domain with little to no annotated data. However, their potential in analyzing health-related social media data remains underexplored. In this paper, we report empirical evaluations of LLMs (GPT-3.5-Turbo, FLAN-T5, and BERT-based models) on a common NLP task of health-related social media data: sentiment analysis for identifying opinions toward health issues. We explored how different prompting and fine-tuning strategies affect the performance of LLMs on social media datasets across diverse health topics, including Healthcare Reform, vaccination, mask wearing, and healthcare service quality. We found that LLMs outperformed VADER, a widely used off-the-shelf sentiment analysis tool, but are far from being able to produce accurate sentiment labels. However, their performance can be improved by data-specific prompts with information about the context, task, and targets. The highest performing LLMs are BERT-based models that were fine-tuned on aggregated data. We provided practical tips for researchers to use LLMs on health-related social media data for optimal outcomes. We also discuss future work needed to continue to improve the performance of LLMs for analyzing health-related social media data with minimal annotations."
"With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), social biases in the LLMs have become a crucial issue. While various benchmarks for social biases have been provided across languages, the extent to which Japanese LLMs exhibit social biases has not been fully investigated. In this study, we construct the Japanese Bias Benchmark dataset for Question Answering (JBBQ) based on the English bias benchmark BBQ, and analyze social biases in Japanese LLMs. The results show that while current Japanese LLMs improve their accuracies on JBBQ by instruction-tuning, their bias scores become larger. In addition, augmenting their prompts with warning about social biases reduces the effect of biases in some models."
"This tutorial will delve into the fascinating realm of simulating human society using Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents, exploring their applications in cities, social media, and economic systems. Through this tutorial, participants will gain insights into the integration of LLMs into human society simulation, providing a comprehensive understanding of how these models can accurately represent human interactions, decision-making processes, and societal dynamics from cities to social media and to economic systems. The tutorial will introduce the essential background, discuss the motivation and challenges, and elaborate on the recent advances."
"Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI) due to recent technological breakthroughs. Their remarkable success in aiding various Software Engineering (SE) tasks through AI-powered tools and assistants has led to the integration of LLMs as active contributors within development teams, ushering in novel modes of communication and collaboration. However, great power comes with great responsibility: ensuring that these models meet fundamental ethical principles such as fairness is still an open challenge. In this light, our vision paper analyzes the existing body of knowledge to propose a conceptual model designed to frame ethical, social, and cultural considerations that researchers and practitioners should consider when defining, employing, and validating LLM-based approaches for software engineering tasks."
"Misinformation undermines public trust in science and democracy, particularly on social media where inaccuracies can spread rapidly. Experts and laypeople have shown to be effective in correcting misinformation by manually identifying and explaining inaccuracies. Nevertheless, this approach is difficult to scale, a concern as technologies like large language models (LLMs) make misinformation easier to produce. LLMs also have versatile capabilities that could accelerate misinformation correction; however, they struggle due to a lack of recent information, a tendency to produce plausible but false content and references, and limitations in addressing multimodal information. To address these issues, we propose MUSE, an LLM augmented with access to and credibility evaluation of up-to-date information. By retrieving contextual evidence and refutations, MUSE can provide accurate and trustworthy explanations and references. It also describes visuals and conducts multimodal searches for correcting multimodal misinformation. We recruit fact-checking and journalism experts to evaluate corrections to real social media posts across 13 dimensions, ranging from the factuality of explanation to the relevance of references. The results demonstrate MUSE's ability to correct misinformation promptly after appearing on social media; overall, MUSE outperforms GPT-4 by 37% and even high-quality corrections from laypeople by 29%. This work underscores the potential of LLMs to combat real-world misinformation effectively and efficiently."
"We study the emergence of agency from scratch by using Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents. In previous studies of LLM-based agents, each agent’s characteristics, including personality and memory, have traditionally been predefined. We focused on how individuality, such as behavior, personality, and memory, can be differentiated from an undifferentiated state. The present LLM agents engage in cooperative communication within a group simulation, exchanging context-based messages in natural language. By analyzing this multi-agent simulation, we report valuable new insights into how social norms, cooperation, and personality traits can emerge spontaneously. This paper demonstrates that autonomously interacting LLM-powered agents generate hallucinations and hashtags to sustain communication, which, in turn, increases the diversity of words within their interactions. Each agent’s emotions shift through communication, and as they form communities, the personalities of the agents emerge and evolve accordingly. This computational modeling approach and its findings will provide a new method for analyzing collective artificial intelligence."
"Abstract Background Rates of suicide have increased by over 35% since 1999. Despite concerted efforts, our ability to predict, explain, or treat suicide risk has not significantly improved over the past 50 years. Objective The aim of this study was to use large language models to understand natural language use during public web-based discussions (on Reddit) around topics related to suicidality. Methods We used large language model–based sentence embedding to extract the latent linguistic dimensions of user postings derived from several mental health–related subreddits, with a focus on suicidality. We then applied dimensionality reduction to these sentence embeddings, allowing them to be summarized and visualized in a lower-dimensional Euclidean space for further downstream analyses. We analyzed 2.9 million posts extracted from 30 subreddits, including r/SuicideWatch, between October 1 and December 31, 2022, and the same period in 2010. Results Our results showed that, in line with existing theories of suicide, posters in the suicidality community (r/SuicideWatch) predominantly wrote about feelings of disconnection, burdensomeness, hopeless, desperation, resignation, and trauma. Further, we identified distinct latent linguistic dimensions (well-being, seeking support, and severity of distress) among all mental health subreddits, and many of the resulting subreddit clusters were in line with a statistically driven diagnostic classification system—namely, the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP)—by mapping onto the proposed superspectra. Conclusions Overall, our findings provide data-driven support for several language-based theories of suicide, as well as dimensional classification systems for mental health disorders. Ultimately, this novel combination of natural language processing techniques can assist researchers in gaining deeper insights about emotions and experiences shared on the web and may aid in the validation and refutation of different mental health theories."
"Social media platforms are used widely by all people to express their feelings, opinions, and emotional states. Billions of people worldwide use them daily to share what they think and feel in their posts. Amongst all social media available platforms, Facebook only contains around three billion personal accounts. In this work Reddit dataset is used to automatically detect mental illness from social media posts. This study is not only limited to early detection of already existing mental illness or disorder like depression and anxiety from social posts, but also and most importantly the study is extended to predict successfully potential mental illness that would happen in future. This study deploys Nineteen different models to study the capability of them in detecting and predicting mental disorders from social media posts. Some of the deployed models are classical machine learning classifiers, some are ensemble learning models, and the rest are large language models (LLMs). Six machine learning classifiers were used in this work for the automatic detection and prediction of mental illness and logistic regression proved to be the best amongst other classifiers in this task. Nine Ensemble methods were also used and examined. Amongst the Nine ensemble learning models VC2, Light GBM, Bagging estimator, and XGBoost proved to be superior in this task. Four large language models were also used and examined for the same task. RoBERTa and OpenAI GPT proved to outperform the rest of models in this task. All those models were built, trained, tested, and compared with previous work in literature to get the best possible results. The study covers the main four mental disorders which are ADHD, Anxiety, Bipolar, and Depression. The work proposed in this paper succeeded in outperforming the results in literature in terms of number of addressed mental disorders, number of models used and tested, and dataset size used to validate results. The proposed work also outperformed the only attempt in literature that addressed all mental disorders in results of detection and prediction noticeably. This work achieved the detection of already existing mental disorders F1-score of 0.80 from clinical data and of 0.52 from non-clinical data, and it achieved a prediction of future mental disorder F1-score of 0.43 from non-clinical data."
"An interactive social robotic assistant must provide services in complex and crowded spaces while adapting its behavior based on real-time human language commands or feedback. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach called Social Robot Planner (SRLM), which integrates Large Language Models (LLM) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to navigate through human-filled public spaces and provide multiple social services. SRLM infers global planning from human-in-loop commands in real-time, and encodes social information into a LLM-based large navigation model (LNM) for low-level motion execution. Moreover, a DRL-based planner is designed to maintain benchmarking performance, which is blended with LNM by a large feedback model (LFM) to address the instability of current text and LLM-driven LNM. Finally, SRLM demonstrates outstanding performance in extensive experiments. More details about this work are available at: https://sites.google.com/view/navi-srlm"
"The interaction of language with perception, action, and cognition has been a recurring theme across the cognitive sciences. Recently, research has emphasized the role of language not only as a communication device but also as a cognitive tool. The rise of large language models (LLMs) and their recent integration in embodied AI systems perceiving and acting in physical and social environments (robotics) is facing similar issues and has the potential to offer insights also into the relationship between language and human cognition. Here we chart parallel developments in these fields with the aim of fostering cross-talk and collaboration. First, we discuss work in psychology and neuroscience on language grounding and the effects of language on perception, action, and other cognitive processes. Next, we explore recent work in machine learning and robotics to design language-conditioned robots that comprehend and act on linguistic instructions, which provide new mechanistic insights on language effects. We conclude by arguing that these new parallel trends of research are finally able to capture the importance of language, in its experiential aspects that involve social interaction, thought, and behavior control."

"The emergence of social norms has attracted much interest in a wide array of disciplines, ranging from social science and cognitive science to artificial intelligence. In this paper, we propose the first generative agent architecture that empowers the emergence of social norms within a population of large language model-based agents. Our architecture, named CRSEC, consists of four modules: Creation & Representation, Spreading, Evaluation, and Compliance. Our architecture addresses several important aspects of the emergent processes all in one: (i) where social norms come from, (ii) how they are formally represented, (iii) how they spread through agents' communications and observations, (iv) how they are examined with a sanity check and synthesized in the long term, and (v) how they are incorporated into agents' planning and actions. Our experiments deployed in the Smallville sandbox game environment demonstrate the capability of our architecture to establish social norms and reduce social conflicts within large language model-based multi-agent systems. The positive outcomes of our human evaluation, conducted with 30 evaluators, further affirm the effectiveness of our approach."
"Human-centered explainable AI (HCXAI) advocates for the integration of social aspects into AI explanations. Central to the HCXAI discourse is the Social Transparency (ST) framework, which aims to make the socio-organizational context of AI systems accessible to their users. In this work, we suggest extending the ST framework to address the risks of social misattributions in Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in sensitive areas like mental health. In fact LLMs, which are remarkably capable of simulating roles and personas, may lead to mismatches between designers' intentions and users' perceptions of social attributes, risking to promote emotional manipulation and dangerous behaviors, cases of epistemic injustice, and unwarranted trust. To address these issues, we propose enhancing the ST framework with a fifth 'W-question' to clarify the specific social attributions assigned to LLMs by its designers and users. This addition aims to bridge the gap between LLM capabilities and user perceptions, promoting the ethically responsible development and use of LLM-based technology."
"In the realm of social media, users frequently convey personal sentiments, with some potentially indicating cognitive distortions or suicidal tendencies. Timely recognition of such signs is pivotal for effective interventions. In response, we introduce two novel annotated datasets from Chinese social media, focused on cognitive distortions and suicidal risk classification. We propose a comprehensive benchmark using both supervised learning and large language models, especially from the GPT series, to evaluate performance on these datasets. To assess the capabilities of the large language models, we employed three strategies: zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning. Furthermore, we deeply explored and analyzed the performance of these large language models from a psychological perspective, shedding light on their strengths and limitations in identifying and understanding complex human emotions. Our evaluations underscore a performance difference between the two approaches, with the models often challenged by subtle category distinctions. While GPT-4 consistently delivered strong results, GPT-3.5 showed marked improvement in suicide risk classification after fine-tuning. This research is groundbreaking in its evaluation of large language models for Chinese social media tasks, accentuating the models' potential in psychological contexts. All datasets and code are made available."
"In this work, we aim to develop LLM agents to mitigate social norm violations in negotiations in a multi-agent setting. We simulate real-world negotiations by letting two large Language Models (LLMs) play the roles of two negotiators in each conversation. A third LLM acts as a remediation agent to rewrite utterances violating norms for improving negotiation outcomes. As it is a novel task, no manually constructed data is available. To address this limitation, we introduce a value impact based In-Context Learning (ICL) method to identify high-quality ICL examples for the LLM-based remediation agents, where the value impact function measures the quality of negotiation outcomes. We show the connection of this method to policy learning and provide rich empirical evidence to demonstrate its effectiveness in negotiations across three different topics: product sale, housing price, and salary negotiation. The source code and the generated dataset will be publicly available upon acceptance."
"Background: Social support (SS) and social isolation (SI) are social determinants of health (SDOH) associated with psychiatric outcomes. In electronic health records (EHRs), individual-level SS/SI is typically documented as narrative clinical notes rather than structured coded data. Natural language processing (NLP) algorithms can automate the otherwise labor-intensive process of data extraction. Data and Methods: Psychiatric encounter notes from Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS, n=300) and Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM, n=225) were annotated and established a gold standard corpus. A rule-based system (RBS) involving lexicons and a large language model (LLM) using FLAN-T5-XL were developed to identify mentions of SS and SI and their subcategories (e.g., social network, instrumental support, and loneliness). Results: For extracting SS/SI, the RBS obtained higher macro-averaged f-scores than the LLM at both MSHS (0.89 vs. 0.65) and WCM (0.85 vs. 0.82). For extracting subcategories, the RBS also outperformed the LLM at both MSHS (0.90 vs. 0.62) and WCM (0.82 vs. 0.81). Discussion and Conclusion: Unexpectedly, the RBS outperformed the LLMs across all metrics. Intensive review demonstrates that this finding is due to the divergent approach taken by the RBS and LLM. The RBS were designed and refined to follow the same specific rules as the gold standard annotations. Conversely, the LLM were more inclusive with categorization and conformed to common English-language understanding. Both approaches offer advantages and are made available open-source for future testing."
"This work offers an integrated methodological framework that integrates the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), rules-based reasoning, multi-criteria sorting, and artificial neural networks (ANN) in developing a predictive model for classifying the intensity of sensitive social media contents. The current literature lacks a holistic consideration of multiple attributes in evaluating social media contents, and the proposed framework intends to bridge such a gap. Three actions constitute the development of the framework. First, LLMs (i.e., GPT4) evaluate the social media contents under a predefined set of attributes, leveraging the power of LLMs in content analytics. Second, rules-based reasoning and multi-criteria sorting (i.e., entropy-FlowSort) determine the categories of social media contents. Lastly, the two previous actions produced a complete dataset that can be used to train a predictive model using ANN to classify sensitive social media contents. With 1100 randomly extracted social media contents and the predefined categories of violations against community standards set by Facebook, the proposed integrated methodology produces an ANN-based classification model with 86.36% prediction accuracy. Comparative analysis using Decision Trees, k-nearest neighbors, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes classification yields the highest performance of ANN. The predictive model can be used as a decision-support tool to design moderation actions on social media contents."
"Abstract Objectives To design a novel artificial intelligence-based software platform that allows users to analyze text data by identifying various coherent topics and parts of the data related to a specific research theme-of-interest (TOI). Materials and Methods Our platform uses state-of-the-art unsupervised natural language processing methods, building on top of a large language model, to analyze social media text data. At the center of the platform’s functionality is BERTopic, which clusters social media posts, forming collections of words representing distinct topics. A key feature of our platform is its ability to identify whole sentences corresponding to topic words, vastly improving the platform’s ability to perform downstream similarity operations with respect to a user-defined TOI. Results Two case studies on mental health among university students are performed to demonstrate the utility of the platform, focusing on signals within social media (Reddit) data related to depression and their connection to various emergent themes within the data. Discussion and Conclusion Our platform provides researchers with a readily available and inexpensive tool to parse large quantities of unstructured, noisy data into coherent themes, as well as identifying portions of the data related to the research TOI. While the development process for the platform was focused on mental health themes, we believe it to be generalizable to other domains of research as well."
"Sporting event outcome prediction is a well-established and actively researched domain, with a particular focus on college basketball's March Madness tournament. Researchers, fans, and gamblers alike seek accurate game-level predictions using features such as tournament seeds, season performance, and expert opinions. While machine learning algorithms have been harnessed to build prediction models, no perfect model or human-created bracket has emerged. This paper explores a novel approach to basketball game outcome prediction by utilizing the power of social networks and large language models (LLMs). LLMs are trained to understand and generate text, often eliminating the need for a feature engineering step. Consequently, our method utilizes tweets from official Division I college basketball team Twitter accounts in the days leading up to a game as context for knowledge discovery and winner prediction with LLMs. To do this, we have compiled a comprehensive dataset of over one million tweets from both men's and women's teams spanning two consecutive seasons. Instead of relying on traditional numeric features, we employ only tweet text with few-shot/zero-shot learning, thereby offering an emerging social network-based approach for sporting event outcome prediction. Furthermore, using chain of thought prompting we investigate the information in team tweets that are predictive of future game performance."
"We present the development of an automated scanning probe microscopy (SPM) measurement system using an advanced large-scale language model (LLM). This SPM system can receive instructions via social networking services (SNS), and the integration of SNS and LLMs enables real-time, language-agnostic control of SPM operations, thereby improving accessibility and efficiency. The integration of LLMs with AI systems with specialized functions brings the realization of self-driving labs closer."
"Patient life circumstances, including social determinants of health (SDOH), shape both health outcomes and care access, contributing to persistent disparities across gender, race, and socioeconomic status. Liver transplantation exemplifies these challenges, requiring complex eligibility and allocation decisions where SDOH directly influence patient evaluation. We developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven framework to analyze how broadly defined SDOH -- encompassing both traditional social determinants and transplantation-related psychosocial factors -- influence patient care trajectories. Using large language models, we extracted 23 SDOH factors related to patient eligibility for liver transplantation from psychosocial evaluation notes. These SDOH ``snapshots'' significantly improve prediction of patient progression through transplantation evaluation stages and help explain liver transplantation decisions including the recommendation based on psychosocial evaluation and the listing of a patient for a liver transplantation. Our analysis helps identify patterns of SDOH prevalence across demographics that help explain racial disparities in liver transplantation decisions. We highlight specific unmet patient needs, which, if addressed, could improve the equity and efficacy of transplant care. While developed for liver transplantation, this systematic approach to analyzing previously unstructured information about patient circumstances and clinical decision-making could inform understanding of care decisions and disparities across various medical domains."
"Prompting serves as the major way humans interact with Large Language Models (LLM). Commercial AI systems commonly define the role of the LLM in system prompts. For example, ChatGPT uses ""You are a helpful assistant"" as part of the default system prompt. But is ""a helpful assistant"" the best role for LLMs? In this study, we present a systematic evaluation of how social roles in system prompts affect model performance. We curate a list of 162 roles covering 6 types of interpersonal relationships and 8 types of occupations. Through extensive analysis of 3 popular LLMs and 2457 questions, we show that adding interpersonal roles in prompts consistently improves the models' performance over a range of questions. Moreover, while we find that using gender-neutral roles and specifying the role as the audience leads to better performances, predicting which role leads to the best performance remains a challenging task, and that frequency, similarity, and perplexity do not fully explain the effect of social roles on model performances. Our results can help inform the design of system prompts for AI systems. Code and data are available at https://github.com/Jiaxin-Pei/Prompting-with-Social-Roles."
"Tobacco companies use social media to bypass marketing restrictions. Studies show that exposure to tobacco promotion on social media influences subsequent smoking behavior, yet it is challenging to monitor such content. We developed an artificial intelligence that can automatically identify tobacco-promoting content on social media. In this mixed methods study, 177,684 tobacco-related tweets published on Twitter in Turkish were collected. Through inductive content analysis of a sample of 200 tweets, the main mechanisms by which tobacco is promoted on social media were identified. Then, a sample of 5000 tweets was deductively analyzed and labeled based on those mechanisms. A pre-trained transformer-based Large Language Model was fine-tuned using the labeled dataset. Then, tobacco promotion in all tweets was predicted using this model. The main mechanisms of tobacco promotion on social media included modeling the behavior, expressing positive attitudes, recommending use, and marketing brands or vendors. The developed model identified tobacco-promoting social media content with 87.8% recall and 81.1% precision. The utility of the model was demonstrated in the analysis of tobacco promotion in tweets for a period of a month. This tool makes it possible to monitor tobacco promotion in social media and creates new opportunities for tobacco control policy and practice, not only in surveillance and enforcement but also in health promotion. Tobacco promotion in social media is a well-known yet hard-to-addressed problem due to the nature of social media. This study leverages a cutting-edge AI approach, Large Language Models, to identify tobacco promotion in social media content automatically and precisely. The developed model offers better prediction performance than previously proposed techniques. The study enables surveillance of tobacco-promoting content both for research purposes and enforcement of tobacco control measures. Furthermore, we suggest a range of health promotion opportunities this tool can help with from developing personal skills to creating supportive environments and strengthening community actions."
"Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is a fundraising method utilized by blockchain startups to raise capital by issuing and selling digital tokens to investors.ICOs have become widely popular for cryptocurrency fundraising, often generating millions of dollars, and surpassing traditional crowdfunding methods like Initial Public Offerings.However, ICO is a risky way of investing and raising capital due to the lack of regulations and standardisation.In this research, we delve into the impact of social media and sentiment analysis on the success of ICOs, employing various machine learning models and Large Language Models.Our analysis is based on data from over 1,000 ICOs gathered from diverse ICO information platforms, coupled with a corpus of 910,478 tweets associated with these ICOs.We extend our investigation to include other social media platforms such as BitcoinTalk, Telegram, Facebook, and Medium.Our analysis revealed that valuable insights regarding the success of ICOs can be derived by examining text sentiment and investigating metadata across these diverse social media channels."
"This paper proposes temporally aligned Large Language Models (LLMs) as a tool for longitudinal analysis of social media data. We fine-tune Temporal Adapters for Llama 3 8B on full timelines from a panel of British Twitter users, and extract longitudinal aggregates of emotions and attitudes with established questionnaires. We validate our estimates against representative British survey data and find strong positive, significant correlations for several collective emotions. The obtained estimates are robust across multiple training seeds and prompt formulations, and in line with collective emotions extracted using a traditional classification model trained on labeled data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to extend the analysis of affect in LLMs to a longitudinal setting through Temporal Adapters. Our work enables new approaches towards the longitudinal analysis of social media data."
"The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in social robotics presents a unique set of ethical challenges and social impacts. This research is set out to identify ethical considerations that arise in the design and development of these two technologies in combination. Using LLMs for social robotics may provide benefits, such as enabling natural language open-domain dialogues. However, the intersection of these two technologies also gives rise to ethical concerns related to misinformation, non-verbal cues, emotional disruption, and biases. The robot's physical social embodiment adds complexity, as ethical hazards associated with LLM-based Social AI, such as hallucinations and misinformation, can be exacerbated due to the effects of physical embodiment on social perception and communication. To address these challenges, this study employs an empirical design justice-based methodology, focusing on identifying socio-technical ethical considerations through a qualitative co-design and interaction study. The purpose of the study is to identify ethical considerations relevant to the process of co-design of, and interaction with a humanoid social robot as the interface of a LLM, and to evaluate how a design justice methodology can be used in the context of designing LLMs-based social robotics. The findings reveal a mapping of ethical considerations arising in four conceptual dimensions: interaction, co-design, terms of service and relationship and evaluates how a design justice approach can be used empirically in the intersection of LLMs and social robotics."
"In the dynamic field of artificial intelligence (AI), the development and application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for text analysis are of significant academic interest. Despite the promising capabilities of various LLMs in conducting qualitative analysis, their use in the humanities and social sciences has not been thoroughly examined. This article contributes to the emerging literature on LLMs in qualitative analysis by documenting an experimental study involving GPT-4. The study focuses on performing thematic analysis (TA) using a YouTube dataset derived from an EU-funded project, which was previously analyzed by other researchers. This dataset is about the representation of Roma migrants in Sweden during 2016, a period marked by the aftermath of the 2015 refugee crisis and preceding the Swedish national elections in 2017. Our study seeks to understand the potential of combining human intelligence with AI's scalability and efficiency, examining the advantages and limitations of employing LLMs in qualitative research within the humanities and social sciences. Additionally, we discuss future directions for applying LLMs in these fields."
"The progress in natural language processing (NLP) using large language models (LLMs) has greatly improved patient information extraction from clinical narratives. However, most methods based on the fine-tuning strategy have limited transfer learning ability for cross-domain applications. This study proposed a novel approach that employs a soft prompt-based learning architecture, which introduces trainable prompts to guide LLMs toward desired outputs. We examined two types of LLM architectures, including encoder-only GatorTron and decoder-only GatorTronGPT, and evaluated their performance for the extraction of social determinants of health (SDoH) using a cross-institution dataset from the 2022 n2c2 challenge and a cross-disease dataset from the University of Florida (UF) Health. The results show that decoder-only LLMs with prompt tuning achieved better performance in cross-domain applications. GatorTronGPT achieved the best F1 scores for both datasets, outperforming traditional fine-tuned GatorTron by 8.9% and 21.8% in a cross-institution setting, and 5.5% and 14.5% in a cross-disease setting."
"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in NLP tasks. However, there is a paucity of studies that attempt to evaluate their performances on social media-based health-related natural language processing tasks, which have traditionally been difficult to achieve high scores in. We benchmarked one supervised classic machine learning model based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs), three supervised pretrained language models (PLMs) based on RoBERTa, BERTweet, and SocBERT, and two LLM based classifiers (GPT3.5 and GPT4), across 6 text classification tasks. We developed three approaches for leveraging LLMs for text classification: employing LLMs as zero-shot classifiers, us-ing LLMs as annotators to annotate training data for supervised classifiers, and utilizing LLMs with few-shot examples for augmentation of manually annotated data. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that employ-ing data augmentation using LLMs (GPT-4) with relatively small human-annotated data to train lightweight supervised classification models achieves superior results compared to training with human-annotated data alone. Supervised learners also outperform GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 in zero-shot settings. By leveraging this data augmentation strategy, we can harness the power of LLMs to develop smaller, more effective domain-specific NLP models. LLM-annotated data without human guidance for training light-weight supervised classification models is an ineffective strategy. However, LLM, as a zero-shot classifier, shows promise in excluding false negatives and potentially reducing the human effort required for data annotation. Future investigations are imperative to explore optimal training data sizes and the optimal amounts of augmented data."
"Believable proxies of human behavior can empower interactive applications ranging from immersive environments to rehearsal spaces for interpersonal communication to prototyping tools. In this paper, we introduce generative agents: computational software agents that simulate believable human behavior. Generative agents wake up, cook breakfast, and head to work; artists paint, while authors write; they form opinions, notice each other, and initiate conversations; they remember and reflect on days past as they plan the next day. To enable generative agents, we describe an architecture that extends a large language model to store a complete record of the agent's experiences using natural language, synthesize those memories over time into higher-level reflections, and retrieve them dynamically to plan behavior. We instantiate generative agents to populate an interactive sandbox environment inspired by The Sims, where end users can interact with a small town of twenty-five agents using natural language. In an evaluation, these generative agents produce believable individual and emergent social behaviors. For example, starting with only a single user-specified notion that one agent wants to throw a Valentine's Day party, the agents autonomously spread invitations to the party over the next two days, make new acquaintances, ask each other out on dates to the party, and coordinate to show up for the party together at the right time. We demonstrate through ablation that the components of our agent architecture—observation, planning, and reflection—each contribute critically to the believability of agent behavior. By fusing large language models with computational interactive agents, this work introduces architectural and interaction patterns for enabling believable simulations of human behavior."
"Abstract Large language models, particularly those akin to the rapidly progressing GPT series, are gaining traction for their expansive influence. While there is keen interest in their applicability within medical domains such as psychology, tangible explorations on real-world data remain scant. Concurrently, users on social media platforms are increasingly vocalizing personal sentiments; under specific thematic umbrellas, these sentiments often manifest as negative emotions, sometimes escalating to suicidal inclinations. Timely discernment of such cognitive distortions and suicidal risks is crucial to effectively intervene and potentially avert dire circumstances. Our study ventured into this realm by experimenting on two pivotal tasks: suicidal risk and cognitive distortion identification on Chinese social media platforms. Using supervised learning as a baseline, we examined and contrasted the efficacy of large language models via three distinct strategies: zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning. Our findings revealed a discernible performance gap between the large language models and traditional supervised learning approaches, primarily attributed to the models' inability to fully grasp subtle categories. Notably, while GPT-4 outperforms its counterparts in multiple scenarios, GPT-3.5 shows significant enhancement in suicide risk classification after fine-tuning. To our knowledge, this investigation stands as the maiden attempt at gauging large language models on Chinese social media tasks. This study underscores the forward-looking and transformative implications of using large language models in the field of psychology. It lays the groundwork for future applications in psychological research and practice."
"Background Despite the reinstatement of proactive human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine recommendations in 2022, Japan continues to face persistently low HPV vaccination rates, which pose significant public health challenges. Misinformation, complacency, and accessibility issues have been identified as key factors undermining vaccine uptake. Objective This study aims to examine the evolution of public attitudes toward HPV vaccination in Japan by analyzing social media content. Specifically, we investigate the role of misinformation, public health events, and cross-vaccine attitudes (eg, COVID-19 vaccines) in shaping vaccine hesitancy over time. Methods We collected tweets related to the HPV vaccine from 2011 to 2021. Natural language processing techniques and large language models (LLMs) were used for stance analysis of the collected data. Time series analysis and latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling were used to identify shifts in public sentiment and topic trends over the decade. Misinformation within opposed-stance tweets was detected using LLMs. Furthermore, we analyzed the relationship between attitudes toward HPV and COVID-19 vaccines through logic analysis. Results Among the tested models, Gemini 1.0 pro (Google) achieved the highest accuracy (0.902) for stance analysis, improving to 0.968 with hyperparameter tuning. Time series analysis identified significant shifts in public stance in 2013, 2016, and 2020, corresponding to key public health events and policy changes. Topic modeling revealed that discussions around vaccine safety peaked in 2015 before declining, while topics concerning vaccine effectiveness exhibited an opposite trend. Misinformation in topic ""Scientific Warnings and Public Health Risk"" in the sopposed-stance tweets reached a peak of 2.84% (47/1656) in 2012 and stabilized at approximately 0.5% from 2014 onward. The volume of tweets using HPV vaccine experiences to argue stances on COVID-19 vaccines was significantly higher than the reverse. Conclusions Based on observation on the public attitudes toward HPV vaccination from social media contents over 10 years, our findings highlight the need for targeted public health interventions to address vaccine hesitancy in Japan. Although vaccine confidence has increased slowly, sustained efforts are necessary to ensure long-term improvements. Addressing misinformation, reducing complacency, and enhancing vaccine accessibility are key strategies for improving vaccine uptake. Some evidence suggests that confidence in one vaccine may positively influence perceptions of other vaccines. This study also demonstrated the use of LLMs in providing a comprehensive understanding of public health attitudes. Future public health strategies can benefit from these insights by designing effective interventions to boost vaccine confidence and uptake."
